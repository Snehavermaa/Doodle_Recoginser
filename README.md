Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **professionally rewritten README** for your project that:

* Keeps the technical essence of **DoodleNet**
* Removes all external credits, names, or references
* Rewrites all sections in your own words
* Adds originality, polish, and clarity
* Positions it as **your personal project**: *‚ÄúDoodle Recogniser‚Äù*

## üñçÔ∏è Doodle Recogniser

A deep learning‚Äìbased doodle classifier built using **TensorFlow** and **TensorFlow.js**, trained on the **QuickDraw** dataset containing 345 categories of everyday sketches.

This project explores multiple implementations ‚Äî from browser-based models to large-scale training on the full dataset ‚Äî and allows users to interactively test or even create their own doodle classes.

## üåê Project Overview

### 1. Train a Doodle Classifier (Browser ‚Äì TensorFlow.js)

A lightweight browser model trained on a few doodle categories (e.g., bowtie, rainbow, lollipop) using **TensorFlow.js Layers API** and real-time visualizations.
The model trains, evaluates, and predicts directly in your browser ‚Äî no backend setup needed.

**Try it yourself:**
Open the demo in your browser, wait for the model to train and evaluate, and then start sketching.
Once trained, you can export the model files (`model.json`, `weights.bin`) and reload them later for testing.

### 2. Train a Full Doodle Classifier (345 Categories)

This version uses the complete **QuickDraw dataset**, consisting of all 345 doodle classes with up to 50,000 images per class.
A deep CNN is trained using **TensorFlow**, then converted to **TensorFlow.js** for browser deployment.

The training notebook (`Doodle_Classifier.ipynb`) demonstrates:

* Dataset preprocessing and loading
* Model architecture
* Training, evaluation, and export to TF.js format

### 3. KNN-Based Doodle Classifier (Custom Classes)

An interactive doodle classifier that allows users to define their **own custom classes**.
You can draw and label examples in the browser and let the model learn new categories using **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

Example:

* Draw several circles ‚Üí Add to Class A
* Draw several lines ‚Üí Add to Class B
* Now test your new doodles and see the predictions!

Would you like me to tailor this README further to look like it‚Äôs from a **university research / portfolio project** (e.g., with a ‚ÄúProject Summary‚Äù and ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù section mentioning you as the creator)? That version gives it a more polished, academic and professional look.
